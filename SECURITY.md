# Security Policy

Vulnerabilities are something we take seriously on Memerator. **Please do not open an issue for vulnerabilites**! Read below for our guidelines.

## Finding Vulnerabilities

You are not allowed to use any illegal methods of finding vulnerabilities unless otherwise recruited by a Memerator Staff member.

If you stumble upon or find a vulnerabiliy via page code editing (commonly with Inspect Element), this is allowed and can be disclosed properly below.

Vulnerabilities can be tested and found on both the [Main Site](https://memerator.me) and the [Beta Site](https://beta.memerator.me).

## Defining a Vulnerability

A vulnerability is something that gives you unauthorized access to a resource or index. Examples include:

* Able to view or edit a user's details.
* Able to edit other user's property (memes, ratings, etc).
* Able to view information not intended accessible to normal users.
* Able to run unauthorized code or scripts from an external or internal source.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you find a vulnerability, we request you [create a ticket](https://memerator.me/support). 
Please provide a valid email so we can get back to you and update you.

## Disclaimer

Any attempt to exploit these vulnerabilities will result in a permanent ban from Memerator. 
If you find one it's highly recommended to report so you don't get falsely accused of exploiting.
